  "description" : "Hello my loyal followers! I have another gift for you all! This one is based on the game Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, which I hope at least some of you are familiar with.\n\n[h1]PLEASE NOTE:[/h1]\nThis mod is NOT clientside, if you wish to play with this content with a friend or on a server, both you and your friend or server must also be subscribed to this mod. It may be incompatible with mods that use neb-hfmurasama in their id or file paths.\nIt IS compatible with FU and Elithian Races Mod\n\n[h1]The funny sword:[/h1]\n[b]HF Murasama[/b]\nYou know it, its the funny katana that makes people sing.\n- Primary ability:\nA fast 6 hit combo with a blade barrage finisher, where you sheath the blade and release a bunch of slashes on the nearest enemy.\n- Alt ability:\nA chargeup swing. If released before max charge, will block and parry hits. If charged fully, signified by the massive ring shrinking completely, you have a short period of time before it auto swings, unleashing a powerful uppercut. This uppercut can deflect projectiles, and consumes your energy. The uncharged variant of this swing can be meshed into your combo freely, replacing a swing in your combo. It has a higher base damage. You can also fully charge at any point in the combo for bonus damage, where if you unleash a charge swing in place of the blade barrage, you can deal massive damage.\n\n[h1]The funny dog:[/h1]\nOn the following planets, an occassus cultist base dungeon can spawn, housing the a new boss;\n- Forest\n- Desert\n- Savannah\n- Snow\n- Jungle\n- Alien\n- Tundra\n- Midnight\n- Volcanic\n- Scorched\n\nKnown as \"Cultist Prototype: BL4D3W0LF\", the bladewolf is a culstist-born mechanic wolf, with a katana for a tail. It has solus capacitors built in which it saves for a tough fight.\nHe has a multitude of attacks, and is very mobile. Normally, he has increased resistance, however after receiving enough damage, or under other circumstances, he will become staggered for a short moment taking full damage.\nUpon dying he has a 10% chance of dropping the HF Mursama at the level of the current planet.\n\nHas a unique version of \"I'm my own Master\" for the boss music mixed by our local music artist, Loib!\n\n[h1]Plans and Notes:[/h1]\n- Leave any found bugs in the comment section along with your log, located in the local files \"/Starbound/storage/starbound.log\". Before sending it, to know it is the right one, enable the see file extensions option in the view settings at the top of the file explorer window on Windows. The correct one will have no numbers after log\n- In the future, I plan to add more Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance content when I get the chance, which will be exciting!\n- There will be more skins added with time\n- Plans to make a small interface with the option to enable the sheath being active at all times, even when the sword is unequipped, as long as it is in your inventory\n\n[h1]Credits:[/h1]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/MoistCrevace]Neb[/url]: The beginning, the entire sword, and the spritework for the boss\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198836604764]SirBucketKicker [/url]: For coding the nigh entirety of the boss, and minor touchups on the sword\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/loiber]Loib[/url]: For creating the boss track for Bladewolf, its an awesome remix!\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198077652646]Moncia[/url]: Created the dungeon for the boss, which helped a ton with progress\nTea-Loving Lad: Worked on the thumbnail and was a pleasure to talk to\nFizz The Moth: For commissioning this work\n\n[h1]PR? Like purple rain..?[/h1]\nI have a patreon [url=https://www.patreon.com/Nebulox]here![/url] It comes with a few perks that we can discuss via Discord DMs!\n\nAlso look forward to my upcoming mods!\n- Revisualiser\nThe skin system, it will release very soon! This weapon actually already has 3 built in skins, so get excited for that!\n- Animated Armours\nThis is a package of two mods. One will be the framework and system so other mods can use it, including vanilla compatible ones. And the other is a set of animations for vanilla armour sets to give them some life!\n- Narthex\nA flying blood sword with a full set of flying combos, along with a handheld ability for a movement based combo! It is almost complete and will release soon\n- CityScaper\nA mod similar to the architects table, but is relatively more versatile with some more freedom and control regarding how it works. Allows placing of dungeons and \"rooms\" which will let you build up cities really quickly! Will release with some modules that add custom modded \"rooms\" like Arcana or Shellguard!\n\nI also have a new guide for modding starbound, useful for beginners and veterans! Check it out [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2574693146]here![/url]\n\nI hang around a few discord servers:\nThe [url=https://discord.gg/uzFUnT5uDQ]Starforge server[/url]\nThe [url=https://discord.gg/Starbound]Starbound server[/url] \nMy [url=https://discord.gg/t/mkWruEK]Discord Server[/url]\nThe [url=https://discord.gg/t2rWTfJ]Eltihian Alliance server[/url]\n\nI am open to commissions, just DM me on discord, at Nebulox#3969.\n\nI don't play this game with people, please, please, please, please stop spamming me.\n\nDon't add me on steam, just message me on discord, my friends list is way too cluttered as it stands right now.",
